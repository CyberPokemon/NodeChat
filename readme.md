# NodeChat

NodeChat is a lightweight, peer-to-peer chat application built in Python using socket programming and a modern GUI powered by [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter).

Unlike traditional chat applications, NodeChat operates entirely on your **local network (LAN)**, requiring **no internet connection or central server**. Each user acts as both a client and a server, enabling fully decentralized, secure, and private messaging.
